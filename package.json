  "description": "TactileJS is a TypeScript library for representing, manipulating, and drawing tilings of the plane.  The tilings all belong to a special class called the _isohedral tilings_. Every isohedral tiling is formed from repeated copies of a single shape, and the pattern of repetition is fairly simple. At the same time, isohedral tilings are very expressive (they form the basis for a lot of the tessellations created by M.C. Escher) and efficient to compute.",
